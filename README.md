# ingres

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Given a gene regulatory boolean network and a RNA-seq dataset, ingres
computes protein activity normalised enrichment scores using VIPER, and
then produces a probabilistic network using the scores as probabilities
for fixed node activation or deactivation, in addition to the original
boolean functions.
