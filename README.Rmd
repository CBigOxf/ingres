_**I**nferring Probabilistic Boolean **N**etworks of **G**ene **R**egulation Using Protein Activity **E**nrichment **S**cores_

Given a gene regulatory boolean network and a RNA-seq dataset, ingres computes protein activity normalised enrichment scores using VIPER, and then produces a probabilistic network using the scores as probabilities for fixed node activation or deactivation, in addition to the original boolean functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ingres with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CBigOxf/ingres")
```
